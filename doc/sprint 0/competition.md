## Team Rocket Event App Competition

Team Rocket Event App is an android app which allows its users to easily create and join local events and meet-ups. Users can browse nearby events through a map interface or search through key words that describes the type of events they are interested in. When an event is found that the user is interested in, they can access the event page which lists all event details and updates. If they would like to attend the event, they can easily indicate that they will be attending by pressing a button.

The main competitor for the Team Rocket Event App is Meetup. Meetup is a website which allows its users to create groups based on similar interests or social identities. These groups will then hold regular meet-ups and events related to that specific interest or social group. Meetup can be found on [https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/) or on IOS and Andriod.

While the Team Rocket Event App and Meetup are similar in that they both have the ability to create events, the Team Rocket Event App addresses some problems with Meetup. 

Since Meetup focuses on groups, there is a level of responsibiliy and commitment for the group creators to host regular weekly events. With the Team Rocket Event App, it will focus on individual events. This will allow users to create one-time-only events without the burden to create further events. 

Another problem with Meetup is that there are events that does not belong to any social groups or are not easily classified under a specific interest. With the Team Rocket Event App, users can create and join these types of events without creating or joining a group. 

Overall, Team Rocket Event App's focus on individual events rather than social groups makes it much better in certain scenarios than its main competition Meetup.
