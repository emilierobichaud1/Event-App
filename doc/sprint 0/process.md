# Process for Sprint 0

The team gathered in person to brainstorm the concept of the project. To discuss ideas, assign tasks, and organize meetings, we used Facebook Messenger. The decisions made for Sprint 0 were all made as a team; one person would suggest an idea and the other memebers would give feedback. The main purpose of this meeting was to come up with the general idea for the project, break that into user stories, discuss UI, and competition. 

A few ideas were thrown out there, but a team memeber suggested a location-based app idea that we decided to pursue. In particular, we discussed which features the app would have, what type of person would use it, and how the app should be designed. We also considered competition; which websites and apps are similar, and what makes ours different. After coming up with the main idea, each team memeber used Pivotal Tracker to add user stories to the product backlog, and we discussed the importance of each user story to give a general ranking.

After this in-person meeting, we used Facebook Messenger to assign specific tasks for Sprint 0. After each teammate was given their task, we still communicated about ideas about user stories, as well as discussion about the UI. 

Overall, the lessons in Sprint 0 stressed the importance of involving the entire team. We realized it's very important to meet in-person to discuss general ideas. This way, every team memeber has the chance to give their input and put their own ideas out there - this communication is better done in-person. Once general ideas have been discussed, it's equally important to assign tasks, as work can be completed faster this way, and because of conflicting schedules, it's not always easy to meet in person frequently.
