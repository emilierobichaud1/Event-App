## Project objectives:
* We need to develop a system within the app that allows users to easily create their own events/meet-ups and easily convey all the relevant details to potential attendees. 
* We will need to develop a backend system to handle user accounts and the data associated with each user within the android ecosystem.
* Develop a UI that allows users to easily find new events that interest them, and view updates and information about events they are planning to attend.

## Key users:
1. **Event Creators:** describes the types of users who are looking to create a new event/meet-up, and are looking for people to join. These event creators are mainly looking to host events occasionally or to host one-off events. 
2. **Event Browsers/attendees:** describes users who are interested in joining groups, such as people who have recently moved to a new location. These users will be interested in the search/exploration features that will allow them to find events that suit their interests.

## Scenarios:
1. Jerry loves to play basketball, but his town doesnâ€™t have any basketball clubs and he has no friends to play basketball with. Jerry needs an easy way to set up his own basketball games for others in his area to join. 
2. Jennifer has recently moved to a new city and is looking to find activities that interest her in the city and make new friends. She needs an easy way to find events close to her that match her interests.

## Principals:
1. **Ease of gaining attendants:** Users creating events should be able to easily gather attendants to their events with minimal marketing effort on their side.
2. **Ease of Use:** The UI must be easy to use and understandable to entry level users who have never used the app before. These users should be able to easily figure out how to create and find/attend events.
3. **Locality:** The app should focus on events that are nearby to the users, to ensure a higher likelihood of users attending events.
