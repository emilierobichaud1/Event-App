Practices our group feels we should continue using is the same as the other sprints. This includes things like using Pivotal Tracker, organizing code well, and communicating well with each other. This allows our team to keep track of the progress of our work easily and causes less confusion between members. 

New practices we would like to follow is better organizing our code. Currently, we have too much code in one file or one method (like onCreate). By separating the code further into separate classes and methods, it will be easier to understand and find problems. We should also bug test more before the sprint is due to prevent any problems during the demo.

Harmful practices we should stop doing is starting our work too late. This caused lots of problems with our app, due to us rushing to meet the deadline. Another thing we should do is test our code more thoroughly before merging to master. This will make it easier to keep track of what bugs have shown up and make it easier to fix, since we know what code we have changed. 

Our best experience with Sprint 3 is that we have most features of our app working. We feel like we are making good progress with our app as we approach the final sprint. Our worst experience was finding bugs during runtime that we have not experience before.
