Practices our group feels we should continue using is the same as last sprint. This includes things like using Pivotal Tracker, organizing code well, and communicating well with each other. This allows our team to keep track of progress of the sprint well and causes less confusion between members. 

New practices we would like to follow is better organizing code into classes. Currently, we have too much in one file. By separating the code further into separate classes, it will be easier to understand and find problems. Another practice we would like to follow is to comment code better. Since we are using some frameworks and libraries some members have not used before, commenting code would lead to less confusion on what certain parts do.

Harmful practices we should stop doing is starting late. Due to starting late, we were not able to thoroughly test our code before merging to master. This caused lots of problems with our app, and forced us to quickly find a fix before the due date. Another thing we should stop doing is putting too much code into the activity classes. The activity classes have lots of duplicate code that we have not separated into new classes. This makes our code inefficient and difficult for the team to understand.

Our best experience with Sprint 2 is that we finally got the map to work. Adding an interactive map took lots of time as we had to learn how to implement the Google Maps API. Also, it is an important part of our app. Our worst experience was the problems with our app near the end of the due date. Our team was rushing the night before to have a working app before the TA presentation.
