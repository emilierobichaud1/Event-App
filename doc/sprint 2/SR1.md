	A practice our group feels we should keep is using Pivotal Tracker to keep track of each user story. This allows us to assign owners and add tasks to user stories more efficiently. Also, it is easier for members to see who is doing what if they need to communicate with them. We will also continue to work on each task on a separate branch and continue to have detailed commit messages. This allows us to keep the flow of the project consistent and allows other members to know what has been updated with each commit. Lastly, we will continue to communicate well with each other. Members were quick to respond to questions and were willing to explain their code to other members, which led to less confusion on code logic and syntax.

	A new practices we would like to follow is more in person meetings, this will allow us to communicate more easily than using a group chat. We will also try and assign tasks more clearly. In phase 1, it was not very clear from the beginning who was doing what for some parts, members just took on tasks that needed to be completed. Next phase we will try to assign tasks from the start so we know what to work on throughout the sprint. Lastly, we will try to make our user stories more clear in Pivotal Tracker. Our TA told us that a user story should be a complete feature that a user would be able to use. In our Pivotal Tracker our user stories were more like tasks, they would not be able to act as a feature on their own. So next phase we will define our user stories better and list the tasks within them.

	A practice we will stop doing next sprint is coding without planning the layout and logic of our code. This sprint we just coded without planning, due to a lack of time, which led to unorganized code. Next sprint, by clearly defining users stories and their tasks, and by assigning them to members earlier, we should be able to have more time to layout the plan for the code, and better structure our project.

	Our best experience with sprint 1 was learning how easy it was to integrate Firebase into our application. Firebase was quickly learned with the help of official tutorials online and with guides within Android Studio. The worst experience from sprint 1 was testing our application with the Android Emulator. The emulator is very heavy on processing power, so it did not run very well on some members computers. We also had difficulty at the beginning when developing for multiple phones due to devicesâ€™ different resolutions and specifications.
